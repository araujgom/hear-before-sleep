# Hear Before you Sleep üé∂

The main goal of this project is to provide students and professionals with a simple and practical application for building AI agent systems. In this case, the system is designed to generate content for a daily music recommendation newsletter, helping users discover new styles and artists.

## Under the Hoods üõ†Ô∏è

The project was built using the [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) framework, enabling the creation of a simple and efficient content generation system. To create the daily content, the system uses a workflow containing two agents:

* [Theme Agent](agents/theme_agent.py): It's responsible for selecting a daily theme for the music recommendations. In order to improve the agent creativiness, we also pass a group of random categories to be used as inspiration for the theme selection.
* [Curation Agent](agents/curation_agent.py): It's responsible for selecting a list of albums that have synergy with the daily theme. In order to improve the newsletter reader experience, we also enrich the selected album list with their respective Spotify links.

## Prerequisites üìã

To run this project, you will need to have the following environment variables set up:

* `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`: The client ID for your Spotify API application.
* `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`: The client secret for your Spotify API application.
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`: The API key for your OpenAI account.

Just take from `.env.example` file and create a `.env` file with your own credentials.
